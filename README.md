# Markov Chain Text Generator

Welcome to the Markov Chain Text Generator! This Python project uses a Markov Chain model to generate text based on the structure and patterns found in a given input text. Itâ€™s perfect for creating unique and coherent sequences that mimic the style of your source material.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Create new text sequences based on a given input using a Markov Chain model.
- **Flexible Context Size**: Customize the length of the context (n-grams) for more varied text outputs.
- **Probability-Based Sampling**: Generate text with probabilities derived from the input text to ensure realistic outputs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vamsi404/markov-chain-text-generator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   ```bash
   cd markov-chain-text-generator
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries**
   Make sure you have `numpy` installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Generate the Frequency Table

This function creates a table of character frequencies based on the input text and context length (`k`).

```python
def generateTable(data, k=4):
    # Your implementation here
```

### 2. Convert Frequencies to Probabilities

Convert the frequency counts in the table to probabilities.

```python
def convertfreqintoprob(T):
    # Your implementation here
```

### 3. Load Text from a File

Load and preprocess text data from a file.

```python
def load_text(filename):
    # Your implementation here
```

### 4. Train the Markov Chain Model

Train the Markov Chain model using the input text.

```python
def trainMarkovChain(text, k=4):
    # Your implementation here
```

### 5. Sample the Next Character

Sample the next character based on the current context and the trained model.

```python
def sample_next(ctx, T, k):
    # Your implementation here
```

### 6. Generate Text

Generate a new text sequence starting from a given sentence.

```python
def generateText(starting_sent, k=4, max_len=1000):
    # Your implementation here
```

## Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the code:

```python
text_path = "path/to/your/text_file.txt"
text = load_text(text_path)
model = trainMarkovChain(text, k=4)
generated_text = generateText("starting sentence", k=4, max_len=200)
print(generated_text)
```
